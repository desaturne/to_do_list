# To-Do List

This repository contains a simple To-Do List web application developed for a college lab assignment. The project demonstrates fundamental front-end concepts including DOM manipulation, event handling, state persistence using the browser's Local Storage, and responsive styling.

Features
- Tabs for viewing Pending, Completed, and All tasks
- Add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks
- Tasks persisted in browser `localStorage` so they remain between sessions

Quick Start
1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Add tasks using the input field and `Add` button.
3. Use the tabs to filter tasks by status, and the controls to complete or delete tasks.
